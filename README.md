# E-Commerce-Dataset
# About the Project
 ### This project focuses on analyzing and cleaning a massive E-Commerce dataset containing over 287 million records.
  ### The goal is to improve data quality, remove duplicates, and extract key insights about customer behavior and product performance . 
---
# Technologies Used 
- Hadoop Hdfs & Yarn
- Apache Spark
- PySpark
- VS Code
- Kaggle (Data Source)
---
# Progect Workflow

## Project Setup
### Before running the project, make sure the following components are installed:
- Hadoop 3.x
- Apache Spark 4.x
- Python & Pyspark 3.x

  ---
   # How to Run the Project
  To start the Hadoop and Spark services, run the following commands in the terminal:

```

### Upload Data to HDFS

  -Create a directory in HDFS and upload the dataset from the local system 
 ```
# Create a new directory in HDFS
hdfs dfs -mkdir /Asrar1

# Copy the dataset from local machine to HDFS
hdfs dfs -CopyFromLocal /home/asrar/2019-Nov.csv /Asrar1
```

## Spark Optimization :
Spark optimization settings were configured to improve performance and memory management.

The configuration included:
- Increasing **executor and driver memory** to 8 GB.
- Setting the **number of shuffle partitions** to 100 for balanced data distribution.
- Enabling **adaptive query execution** for automatic optimization.
- Enabling **Kryo serialization** for faster data serialization.
```
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
# Initialize Spark session with optimized configurations
spark=SparkSession.builder \
     .appName("NovData") \
     .master("local[*]") \
     .config("spark.executor.memory","8g") \
     .config("spark.driver.memory","8g") \
     .config("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions","100")\
     .config("spark.serializer","org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer") \
     .config("spark.sql.adaptive.enabled","True") \
     .config("spark.sql.adaptive.coalescePartitions.enabled","true") \
     .config("spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.enabled","true") \
     .getOrCreate()
spark.sparkContext.setLogLevel("ERROR")
```

## Data Processing & Analysis
### 1.Data Transformation
**Separated the date and time** from the event timestamp into two independent columns (`event_date` and `event_time`) to make time-based analysis easier.

### 2.Data Cleaning
